4. web3 v1.2.9
5. Metamask Chrome Extension
6.VS Code

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes

### Prerequisites

Please make sure you've already installed ganache-cli, Truffle, Solidity, nodejs  and enabled MetaMask extension in your browser.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Clone this repository:

In a separate terminal window, Compile smart contracts:

```
truffle compile
```

Your terminal should look something like this:

![truffle compile](images/truffle-compile.png)

This will create the smart contract artifacts in folder `build\contracts`.

Migrate smart contracts to the locally running blockchain, ganache-cli:

```
truffle migrate --reset
```

Your terminal should look something like this:

![truffle migrate](images/truffle-migrate.png)

Test smart contracts:

```
truffle test
```

All 19 tests should pass.
